# Polynomial_Regressor
A comparison of Polynomial Regression and Linear Regression 
Both models have been created and comapred from scratch of a simple dataset that predicts the salary based on the level of the person (pls see the data set).The liner model easy to use and a simple but does not fit some data types.The polynomial Regression uses varying degree's of the independent variable to estimate the data.
This is a comparison of the two model in which the polynomial regression performs better.
The model can be used for any other dataset.
